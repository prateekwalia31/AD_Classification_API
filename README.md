# AD_Classification
 
This repository contains a Flask API for a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for MRI based Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection and classification.

## Description

In this project, we aim to classify brain MRI images related to Alzheimer's Disease using a CNN-based approach. The trained CNN model provided in this repository can be used to classify brain MRI scans and make predidctions on whether a subject is suffereing from AD or not, and classify the brain scan into one of the following four classes: Cognitive Normal (CN), Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and AD.
